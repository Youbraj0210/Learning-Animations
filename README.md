I made this mini project in order to learn how to make animations, so as to make the ui more impressive and user friendly...
for animations I used GSAP, Locomotive and GSAP-ScrollTrigger.
some key points to remember:
<ul>
  <h3>The order the the scripts will always be</h3>
  <li>Locomotive</li>
  <li>gsap</li>
  <li>gsap-scrollTrigger</li>
  <h3>Locomotive</h3>
  <li>locomotive disrupts all the other animation ie it wont let others to make changes in animation</li>
  <li>therfore use locomotive with scrolltrigger from the locomotive scrollTrigger codepen</li>
  <li>It also doesnt work that good with position fixed</li>
</ul>
